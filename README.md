**Thread Shed Project**: 
A program designed to organize and sort messy data in the form of one giant string. In order to, sort information and gain insight into sales. 
After cleaning and sorting the data. I'm able to find the total revenue for the day as well as how much of what individual item was sold.

**Page Visits Funnel**:
Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:
1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks “checkout”
4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt

After importing the data I analyze each step of the buying process to determine the likelihood a sale is made once a customer gets so far into the process. I've also determined that once a user adds an item into their cart a sale is most likely, yet ~87% of people only visit and do not add something to their cart.
